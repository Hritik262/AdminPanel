# üñ•Ô∏èüñ•Ô∏è Backend Task | Admin Panel API

## Made With

- **Node.js**
- **Express.js**
- **TypeScript**
- **PostgreSQL**
- **Sequelize ORM**
- **JWT (jsonwebtoken)**
- **Joi**

  
## Objective

Create a backend API using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **PostgreSQL** to support an **Admin Panel** with the following features:

- **Admin** can create projects and assign managers to them.
- **Managers** can assign employees to the projects they manage.
- **Employees** can view the projects assigned to them.
- Only the **Admin** can create new users by adding their email address and providing them with a password, which the employee or manager can use to log in.

### Through this task, the following aspects will be measured:

- Problem-solving approach and thought process.
- Proficiency in Node.js, Express, and JavaScript concepts.
- Understanding of REST API principles and HTTP methods.
- Ability to design database schemas/models.
- Use of middleware for authentication, access control, and validations.
- Implementation of authentication using JWT tokens.
- Ability to comprehend and execute the requirements of a given task.

## Task Requirements

- **User Authentication:** Create API for user login, allowing all users to log in with their credentials.
- **Admin Registration:** Create an API for Admin registration/signup (only accessible by Admin).
- **Admin User Creation:** Admin can create new users by providing basic details like username, password, email, and role.
- **JWT Authentication:** Use JWT tokens for authentication. Optionally, Passport.js can be used.
- **Authentication Middleware:** Create middleware to verify the user's role and restrict access to specific routes based on their access level.
- **Multi-level Authorization:** Ensure that only Admins can perform certain tasks like user creation and role assignments, while Managers and Employees have restricted access.
- **User Management APIs:** Implement APIs to fetch, update, and soft-delete user data.
- **Role Management APIs:** Implement APIs to assign or reassign roles to users.
- **Project Management APIs:** Implement CRUD APIs for project management.
- **Audit Logs:** Record actions like creating, updating, or deleting resources, along with metadata (who performed the action, what action was taken, and on which entity).
- **Soft Delete Retrieval:** In addition to soft delete, add a route to retrieve soft-deleted resources (e.g., `/users/restore`).
- **Permanent Deletion:** Provide an option to permanently delete soft-deleted resources. (OPTIONAL)
- **Validation Middleware:** Add input validation using **Joi** or **celebrate** for all routes to ensure data integrity. (OPTIONAL)
- **Use an `.env` file:** Store sensitive information like database credentials and authentication secrets in an `.env` file to avoid exposing them in version control (Git).
- **Host the application and database:** Host the application and database on services like **Render**, **Heroku**, or **Railway**.
- **Follow the given checklist:** Make sure to go through the provided checklist for additional requirements and mark items as completed accordingly.

## User Role Based Access

Below is a breakdown of the permissions and restrictions for each user role. Each user can only have one assigned role.

- **User Management:** Create, update, and delete users; assign and reassign roles.
- **Project Management:** Create, update, and delete project data; assign managers to projects.
- **Soft Delete:** Deleted projects are restorable through soft delete implementation.
- **View All Projects:** Including soft-deleted ones.
- **Audit Logs:** Only Admin has access.
- **Single Admin:** Any user created through the signup/register route is automatically assigned the Admin role. There can only be one Admin in this application.

### Manager
